                3D printers are incredible! Seemingly like magic, you can watch a figurine, closet hook, or full fledged 
                prototype come to life as a tangible object. In recent years, these devices have become globally 
                accessible to the public in public libraries, universities, maker spaces, and more.

                This interface for a Prusa 3D printer is designed to be both simple and user-friendly. 
                The four main components handle all tasks from selecting print settings, loading and changing filament, 
                manually controlling printer components for cleaning, and troubleshooting when prints fail.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    They plugged the SD card into the slot, but sometimes it was initially plugged in the incorrect orientation
                </li>
                <li>
                    A hand was almost always kept on the spinning knob and that was the key interactive component that was used most often
                </li>
                <li>Users did not use the standalone button with the “X” on it</li>
                <li>
                    While using the screen, they would often scroll back and forth on the display 
                    even when not applicable to the task, selecting many of the options in the menus
                </li>
                <li>
                    They would occasionally click the wrong selection when pressing the button due 
                    to a small rotation registering before the button press.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They would sometimes spin the knob but the screen would not register their 
                    input, which led to a mix of overcompensation and under compensation of rotations, 
                    leading to backtracking to reach the correct selection
                </li>
                <li>
                    When users were deeper into the nested menus they would spend more time to 
                    read and think through the options
                </li>

                <li>Have you used this model of 3D printer before?</li>
                <li>
                    You want to 3D print something and have your file on an SD card. 
                    What steps do you want to take to upload your data and successfully print?
                </li>
                <li>Looking at this interface, what are your thoughts about how to interact with it?</li>
                <li>
                    <i>The user is presented with a screen from a few nested menus into the software.</i> 
                    What would you do on this screen when you want to go to the home page?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let's say the printer fails and the nozzle needs to be cleaned before restarting. 
                    Can you show me how you would use the interface to move the axes of the printer nozzle?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did you run into scenarios where the result of your action was not what you 
                    anticipated in your mind?
                </li>
                <li>Do you have any additional thoughts on this interface?</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Regardless of experience level with the interface, the controls were 
                    intuitive and users especially gravitated towards the spinning knob.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All users avoided the standalone button in favor of exclusively using the 
                    button within the knob. Multiple users were confused by the presence of the 
                    button and the fact that the protruding wings of the knob covered it, making 
                    it difficult to press.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All users indicated that the experience of needing to enter multiple nested 
                    scrollable menus to access certain functions such as manual nozzle control felt 
                    “clunky”. 1 or 2 levels deep into menus, they would take longer to find the correct 
                    option and would often click on more of the options available to test them out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two flaws existed with the knob. The first was that in the process of pressing 
                    in the knob to make a selection, it was turned ever so slightly and the turn registered 
                    before the press, meaning the incorrect option was selected. The second was that the 
                    knob would sometimes be spun but the screen did not indicate that the action registered.
